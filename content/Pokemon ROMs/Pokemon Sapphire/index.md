## Relive the Nostalgia of the Epic Pokemon Series With Pokemon Sapphire

Pokemon games have earned a special place in the heart of the gaming fraternity, since their advent a few decades ago. Inspired by the classic and undisputedly popular Pokemon TV series, these games have grown to develop a separate and significant space in the world of retro and modern console gaming. Amongst all editions of Pokemon games, Pokemon Sapphire is explicitly loved by gamers across the world, thanks to its remarkable features.

## Pokemon Sapphire: The Launch Story

Developed by Game Freak as a game of role-playing; Pokemon Sapphire was released in 2002 exclusively in Japan, by Nintendo and Pokemon Company in collaboration, on the Gameboy Advance platform. The gameâ€™s popularity caused a global launch of the game a year later in 2003. The game was the first edition in the Pokemon Generation III game series.

## Game Setting and Storyline

Pokemon Sapphire takes place in the Hoenn region, a tropical archipelago. As the game opens up, you are allowed to select one among the 3 Pokemon species, and the gender of the protagonist, who comes up to you in a new outfit. Having done that, you are ready to step into the actual story from your native town.

The game task demands you to catch and evolve Pokemon species to fill your PokÃ©dex. Secondly, you are asked to battle with the Pokemon of the Champion of Elite Four and defeat the same while simultaneously completing 8 gym challenges. Amid your quest, you meet your game rivals, May and Brendan, the shy child who helps you to catch your first Pokemon. Further encounters include Wallace, the Champion of the Hoenn Region.

## Gameplay

The gameâ€™s journey allows you to meet with Team Aqua, whose objective is to expand the sea and benefit Pokemon species by summoning the legendary Pokemon Kyogre. You encounter Team Aqua throughout your journey as they attempt to steal the mystical orbs that can control the weather.

On reaching the last two gyms, Team Aqua calls upon Kyogre through the stolen magical orbs from Mount Pyre. Kyogre unleashes its power, causing torrential rains and devastating floods across the Hoenn region. You must overcome these challenges and ultimately defeat Team Aqua and their leader, Archie.

As you move on to defeat the Elite Four, two Pokemon species, Latios and Latias, welcome you in Hoenn. You are thrown towards new challenges in the Battle Frontier region, while meeting Steven Stone, the Champion of Meteor Falls.

This version of the text specifically highlights the key features and storyline of Pokemon Sapphire, focusing on Team Aqua's role and the impact of Kyogre.
