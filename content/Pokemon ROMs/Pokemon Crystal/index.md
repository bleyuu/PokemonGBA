## Relive the Nostalgia of the Epic Pokemon Series With Pokemon Crystal

Pokemon games have earned a special place in the heart of the gaming fraternity, since their advent a few decades ago. Inspired by the classic and undisputedly popular Pokemon TV series, these games have grown to develop a separate and significant space in the world of retro and modern console gaming. Amongst all editions of Pokemon games, Pokemon Yellow is explicitly loved by gamers across the world, thanks to its unique features.

## Pokemon Crystal: The Launch Story

Developed by Game Freak as a game of role-playing; Pokemon Yellow was released in 1998 exclusively in Japan, by Nintendo and Pokemon Company in collaboration, on the Gameboy platform. The gameâ€™s popularity caused a global launch of the game a year later in 1999. Pokemon Yellow was a special edition released alongside Pokemon Red and Blue, drawing inspiration directly from the anime series.

## Game Setting and Storyline

Pokemon Yellow takes place in the Kanto region, a vibrant land filled with diverse environments. The game's unique feature is that instead of choosing a starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle), you begin your journey with a special Pikachu. This Pikachu follows you on the screen, mimicking your actions and adding a playful touch to the adventure.

The game task demands you to catch and evolve Pokemon species to fill your PokÃ©dex. Secondly, you are asked to battle with the Pokemon of the Elite Four and defeat the same while simultaneously completing 8 gym challenges. Amid your quest, you meet your game rival, Blue, who chooses a rival starter Pokemon to your Pikachu. You also encounter Team Rocket, a criminal organization that seeks to exploit Pokemon for their own gain.

## Gameplay

Pokemon Yellow features several unique elements inspired by the anime.

â€¢ Pikachu follows you: Your Pikachu accompanies you on-screen, adding a visual dimension to the game.        
â€¢ Anime-style encounters: Certain events and encounters are directly inspired by the anime series, creating a familiar and nostalgic experience for fans.                                                                
â€¢ Pikachu's unique abilities: Your Pikachu can learn special moves like Surf and Fly, allowing for more diverse gameplay options.

Your journey involves battling Team Rocket across various locations, including the Viridian Forest and the Silph Co. building. You must overcome their challenges, defeat their leaders, and ultimately become the Pokemon League Champion.

Pokemon Yellow offers a charming and nostalgic experience for fans of the anime, providing a unique and engaging take on the classic Kanto region adventure.
